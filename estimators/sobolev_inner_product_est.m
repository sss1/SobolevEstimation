%   s - order of the Sobolev norm to compute
%   Z - maximum frequency at which to truncate the approximation
%   alpha - level of confidence interval (only used if CI is requested)

%   S_hat - estimated sobolev inner product
%   CI - confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the estimator
